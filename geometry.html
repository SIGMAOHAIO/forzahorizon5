    <h1>Hi guys!If you want some tips for GEOMETRY DASH<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61pg8HkdThL._AC_UF894,1000_QL80_.jpg"width="200px" height="150px" />  before you smash your house of your rage here are some:</h1>


    🟩 1. Practice Mode is your BFF.

Before trying the real level, go to practice mode and learn the level. You can put checkpoints so you don’t have to do the whole thing again when you oof!

🟨 2. DON’T tap like a crazy person.

Just. Don’t. Tap. Too. Much. You’ll fly into spikes and DIE. Wait until it’s the right time to jump or fly.

🟥 3. Music is the key 🔑.

The music tells you when to jump. Listen to the beat! If you hear “duh duh DUH” maybe it’s a jump time! 😎

🟦 4. Watch YouTubers (they are LEGENDS).

Watch people like GD Colon, Geometry Dash SubZero dudes, or RobTop replays. They know the secrets.

🟪 5. Make your own level!!
It’s SO fun and you can put spikes EVERYWHERE and troll your friends lol 😂

🟧 6. Don’t get mad 😡 (okay maybe a little)
You’ll lose like... 7000 times. It’s okay. Breathe. Or throw your tablet on a pillow. Just don’t smash it (unless it’s already cracked).

🟫 7. Know your vehicles.
